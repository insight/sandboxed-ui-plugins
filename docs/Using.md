Using
=====

Usage instructions for _Insight Plugins_ vary depending on the implementation of the _Insight API_ for a given language and library.

While the goal is to standardize the approach long-term, this can only be done once multiple implementations are available.

For information on how to use plugins with [FirePHP](http://reference.developercompanion.com/#/Tools/FirePHPCompanion/Introduction/)
(one implementing library) see: [https://github.com/firephp/ui-plugins](https://github.com/firephp/ui-plugins)
